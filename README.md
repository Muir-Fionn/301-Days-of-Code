## What is #301DaysOfCode?
Want to go from code noob to employed developer in less than a year?

Take the **#301DaysOfCode** and go from Code newbie to an employed Developer in less than a year. The only stipulation: code 3 minutes and 1 second per day for 301 days. Wait! What? Why so little? Check out the FAQ below.

## FAQ:

### Only Code for 3 minutes 1 second per day, Are you crazy?

Of course, I am! But so is the human mind. Did you know that you are more likely to stick with a habit if you keep the barrier to entry low? Just like with exercise we are not trying to max ourselves out every day. Start small with 3min 1 sec. If you only did that; great! If you want to do longer for that day, even better. ðŸ˜‰

### Why 301 Days? Why not 365?

We spend 301 days learning to code. The remaining 64 days of the year are focused on landing a front-end developer job.

Cheers if you got the 301 redirect reference. ðŸ˜‰
