### Day 2: 26 March 2017

**Today's Progress:** Day 12 of 30Days30Sites.  Started designing a club homepage.

**Thoughts:** Laid out HTML. Wrote javascript to build out most of the HTML. Still need to add event listeners and write most of the CSS.

### Day 1: 25 March 2017

**Today's Progress:** Day 11 of 30Days30Sites.  Built a food truck landing page.

**Thoughts:** Posting this update a day late because internet was down yesterday. Got to have fun coding this website locally rather than in CodePen.  I forget how enjoyable that can be sometimes.
